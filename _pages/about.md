I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), working in the [Reactive Systems Group](https://finkbeiner.groups.cispa.de/) led by [Bernd Finkbeiner](https://finkbeiner.groups.cispa.de/people/finkbeiner.html). Before that, I completed my PhD in 2025 at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/) under the supervision of [Tom Henzinger](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/).

My research focuses on *quantitative aspects of software systems*, aiming to develop lightweight and best-effort verification methods that explicitly balance precision against efficiency. I am broadly interested in runtime verification and formal methods, with a soft spot for automata theory.

<!-- # Research

Runtime verification (RV) is a lightweight, dynamic technique that determines whether a system's run satisfies its specification. For this, a monitor watches a trace of a system and, if possible, decides after observing each finite prefix whether or not the unknown infinite trace meets a given specification. Theoretically, RV moves the burden from emptiness checking in static verification to membership checking, an easier problem. This shift introduces the opportunity to use more powerful formalisms.

My research focuses on abstractions that enable reasoning about quantitative information and moving RV to a quantitative setting. Such a setting is attractive because quantitative verdicts can be approximate and thus compared regarding their precision, which may be traded against monitor resources. I aim to develop a framework for online and best-effort quantitative monitoring that subsumes **a cost-centric theory of monitorability** and **a precision-cost theory of approximate monitoring**. Moreover, I plan to extend the framework to monitors that take corrective action and decentralized monitoring.  -->
